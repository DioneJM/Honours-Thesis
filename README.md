Repository for my project: "Detecting health misinformation in web page text using deep learning methods"

## Project Description
The spread of health misinformation can lead to harm in the form of mistreatment and mismanagement of a range of health conditions; vaccination decision making is a common example. This project will involve evaluating the performance of general fake news classifiers on domain specific health-related online articles and investigating the application of attention-based neural network models to quantify and analyse the presence of misinformation in the text of webpages presenting health research news and information.
