The data comprise {\~{}}126,000 stories tweeted by {\~{}}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98{\%} agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTBackground: The importance of social networking sites (SNSs) as platforms to engage in the correction of “fake news” has been documented widely. More evidence is needed to understand the popularity of health-related rumors and how Health Educators can optimize their use of SNSs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the spread of health rumors and verified information on SNSs using the Zika virus as a case study. Methods: A content analysis of Zika-related news stories on SNSs between February 2016 and January 2017 was conducted to verify accuracy (phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by an analysis of volume of shares (phase 2) and a thematic analysis of headlines (phase 3). Results: Rumors had three times more shares than verified stories. Popular rumors portray Zika as a conspiracy against the public and a low-risk issue and connect it to the use of pesticides. Discussion: This study identifies the value of integrating in-depth analysis of popular health-related rumors into the developmen...},

Methods: We used Sandman's model of components predicting community outrage to assess the MMR controversy. Results: The controversy fulfilled all of Sandman's 12 primary components and six of the eight additional components.

@article{QIMR,
	abstract = {The media serves as an important link between medical research, as reported in scholarly sources, and the public and has the potential to act as a powerful tool to improve public health. However, concerns about the reliability of health research reports have been raised. Tools to monitor the quality of health research reporting in the media are needed to identify areas of weakness in health research reporting and to subsequently work towards the efficient use of the lay media as a public health tool through which the public's health behaviors can be improved. We developed the Quality Index for health-related Media Reports (QIMR) as a tool to monitor the quality of health research reports in the lay media. The tool was developed according to themes generated from interviews with health journalists and researchers. Item and domain characteristics and scale reliability were assessed. The scale was correlated with a global quality assessment score and media report word count to provide evidence towards its construct validity. The items and domains of the QIMR demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability. Items from the ‘validity' domain were negatively skewed, suggesting possible floor effect. These items were not eliminated due to acceptable content and face validity. QIMR total scores produced a strong correlation with raters' global assessment and a moderate correlation with media report word count, providing evidence towards the construct validity of the instrument. The results of this investigation indicate that QIMR can adequately measure the quality of health research reports, with acceptable reliability and validity.},

While this may appear, at first, to be a straightforward text classification problem, we show that by considering domain-specic features of this problem, in addition to the raw text of E-mail messages, we can produce much more accurate filters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in a real world usage scenario, arguing that this technology is mature enough for deployment.},

Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes—providing on average a 27{\%} reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.

The attractiveness of ANNs comes from their remarkable information processing characteristics pertinent mainly to nonlinearity, high parallelism, fault and noise tolerance, and learning and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN-based computing (neurocomputing) and to serve as a useful companion practical guide and toolkit for the ANNs modeler along the course of ANN project development. The history of the evolution of neurocomputing and its relation to the field of neurobiology is briefly discussed. ANNs are compared to both expert systems and statistical regression and their advantages and limitations are outlined. A bird's eye review of the various types of ANNs and the related learning rules is presented, with special emphasis on backpropagation (BP) ANNs theory and design. A generalized methodology for developing successful ANNs projects from conceptualization, to design, to implementation, is described. The most common problems that BPANNs developers face during training are summarized in conjunction with possible causes and remedies. Finally, as a practical application, BPANNs were used to model the microbial growth curves of S. flexneri. The developed model was reasonably accurate in simulating both training and test time-dependent growth curves as affected by temperature and pH.},

@article{Cipriani,
	abstract = {Purpose The review focused on the role that media reporting plays in the level of public awareness about osteoporosis and its influence on osteoporosis treatment decisions. Methods We reviewed the literature on the role of media on three main aspects influencing patient adherence to osteoporo-sis treatment: the awareness of osteoporosis as a major health problem, the perception of the effectiveness of osteoporosis medications, and the fear of adverse effects with osteoporosis medications. Results A review of the literature confirmed what is routinely observed in clinical practice-that media report can strongly influence the level of awareness of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Inadequate and/or incorrect information on osteoporosis in the media are associated with a low level of awareness of the disease. High-risk patients may have a poor understanding of the need for treatment. Alarming information in the media over the last 2 decades regarding effectiveness and safety of long-term osteoporosis treatment is associated with reduction in the use of osteoporosis medications. Conclusions There is a gap between the application of clinical recommendations and patient perceptions of osteoporosis and its treatment. There is a need for better education of patients and practitioners aimed at recognizing the serious consequences of fractures and understanding the expected benefits and potential risks of treatment. Media reports that disseminate evidence-based information on the balance of benefits and risks could help to reduce the osteoporosis treatment gap and mitigate the crisis in osteoporosis care.},

@techreport{Kaicker2010,
	abstract = {Background: The Internet is used increasingly by providers as a tool for disseminating pain-related health information and by patients as a resource about health conditions and treatment options. However, health information on the Internet remains unregulated and varies in quality, accuracy and readability. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of pain websites, and explain variability in quality and readability between pain websites. Methods: Five key terms (pain, chronic pain, back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia) were entered into the Google, Yahoo and MSN search engines. Websites were assessed using the DISCERN instrument as a quality index. Grade level readability ratings were assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Algorithm. Univariate (using alpha = 0.20) and multivariable regression (using alpha = 0.05) analyses were used to explain the variability in DISCERN scores and grade level readability using potential for commercial gain, health related seals of approval, language(s) and multimedia features as independent variables. Results: A total of 300 websites were assessed, 21 excluded in accordance with the exclusion criteria and 110 duplicate websites, leaving 161 unique sites. About 6.8{\%} (11/161 websites) of the websites offered patients' commercial products for their pain condition, 36.0{\%} (58/161 websites) had a health related seal of approval, 75.8{\%} (122/161 websites) presented information in English only and 40.4{\%} (65/161 websites) offered an interactive multimedia experience. In assessing the quality of the unique websites, of a maximum score of 80, the overall average DISCERN Score was 55.9 (13.6) and readability (grade level) of 10.9 (3.9). The multivariable regressions demonstrated that website seals of approval (P = 0.015) and potential for commercial gain (P = 0.189) were contributing factors to higher DISCERN scores, while seals of approval (P = 0.168) and interactive multimedia (P = 0.244) contributed to lower grade level readability, as indicated by estimates of the beta coefficients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the quality of sponsored and unsponsored asthma websites using the Brief DISCERN instrument and to evaluate whether the Health On the Net Code of Conduct (HONcode) logo was present, thereby indicating that the site met the criteria. The Internet is an important source of health information for patients and their families. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the quality of sponsored and unsupported asthma websites. A secondary aim was to determine the readability and reading ease of the materials for each website along with the grade level. Methods: We queried seven Internet search engines using the keyword "asthma." The websites were evaluated using the six-item Brief DISCERN instrument and by ascertaining whether the HONcode quality label was present. The websites were also evaluated for readability employing Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Flesch reading ease tools using Microsoft Office Word 2013 software. Results: A total of 22 unique websites were included in the study. Approximately 68{\%} of the websites reviewed had a Brief DISCERN cutoff score of ≥16. The overall Brief DISCERN scores ranged from 6 to 30, and the mean score was 17.32 (SD =6.71). The Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores ranged from 2.9 to 15.4, and the average reading grade score was 9.49 (SD =2.7). The Flesch reading ease scores ranged from 17 to 82.7, with a mean reading ease score of 53.57 (SD =15.03). Sites with a HONcode quality label had significantly higher Brief DISCERN scores than those without one (t=2.3795; df=20; p=0.02). Conclusion: Brief DISCERN scores revealed that there is quality asthma information for children and their families available on the Internet. The grade level ranged between 2.9 and 15.4 among the websites. However, the mean grade level scores were 9.3-9.89, which is high for the average consumer. Access to accurate information via the Internet, with appropriate readability, may enable pediatric asthma patients and their caregivers to better control and manage asthma.},
