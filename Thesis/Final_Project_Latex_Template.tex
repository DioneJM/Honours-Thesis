\documentclass[a4paper,twoside,phd]{BYUPhys}
% The BYUPhys class is for producing theses and dissertations
% in the BYU Department of Physics and Astronomy.  You can supply
% the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces double sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Introduction}

  

One of the key components required to minimize the propagation of misinformation online is to have the ability of automatically evaluating and quantifying the credibility of articles. However, traditional automated methods - such as shallow learning-based techniques, still require the domain knowledge of experts to be able to develop the features required by the model. Thus, this project aims to investigate the performance of Deep Learning-based (DL) techniques in evaluating the credibility of information within domain-specific articles via the classification of set criteria that have deemed to be highly correlated with articles that have low credibility. Specifically, this project will focus on evaluating the credibility of online health articles related to vaccination due to the commonly misinformed and controversial views associated with its effects \cite{Burgess2006}. \newline


\section{Project Overview}
This section details the scope of the project and its associated outcomes outlining the various tasks that must be accomplished to successfully complete the project.

\subsection{Project Scope}
\label{sec:ProjectScope}

With the primary objective of this project being the evaluation on the effectiveness of deep learning models in determining the credibility of online health-related articles. Due to the complexity of this project, a set of activities - divided into main goals and stretch goals, have been defined to ensure that the completion of this project remains feasible in the given time frame. The completion of all activities categorized as main goals will signal the realization of the primary objective and the completion of the project. Stretch goals are activities of interest that have been identified as non-essential to the completion of the primary objective but (talk about the overarching goal that all stretch goals have in common e.g. understand the model, utilize the model etc.) and will be worked on after the completion of the project.

\subsubsection{Main Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop a set of criteria that will be used to determine the credibility of online articles.
	\item Evaluate the performance of common ML-based methods on the classification of online vaccine-related articles, based on the criteria developed.
	\item Evaluate the performance of the proposed DL model on the classification of online vaccine-related articles, based on the criteria developed.
	\item Evaluate the effect of transfer learning methods in the performance of the proposed DL method (assuming that the chosen method doesn't rely on transfer learning)
	\item Evaluate the effectiveness of various transfer learning methods for the classification task
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilize attention mechanisms to understand how the aforementioned DL model classifies the criteria for credibility.
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chap:LitReview}

A literature review has been conducted to develop an understanding on the research that has been done in the assessment of the credibility of information, specifically in the context of information related to health and the limitations and capabilities of shallow learning techniques and how it differs from deep learning-based methods for the task of text classification. 

\section{Assessing Credibility of Information}

To have the capability of automating the process of evaluating the quality or credibility of online information, a definition that outlines of what is required by an article to be considered as a credible source of information must be developed. While there has been a significant amount of research that has been done on the development of tools and frameworks that aim to assess the credibility of online health information, there is currently no standardized method or benchmark that is universally used. Commonly used tools and frameworks are (\textit{Note: add citation for each one}): DISCERN \cite{DISCERN}, HealthNewsReview \cite{HealthNewsReview}, QIMR \cite{QIMR} and (\textit{Wiley 2017 - update this when you find the source})

\textit{Talk about the work done in establishing the measurement of quality in online health information e.g. DISCERN, QIMR and the sources from that document in the slack channel}

Try to understand the following for each source:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How the scoring system works
	\item How credibility is defined
\end{itemize}

\textit{Introduce the state-of-the-art DL based approaches for text classification and try to compare it performance with state-of-the-art ML approaches} \newline
\textit{For each model, talk about the following:}
\newline
\textbf{\textit{NOTE: REMEMBER WHEN WRITING THIS SECTION TO ALWAYS CONSIDER HOW IT DIFFERS TO ML TECHNIQUES}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{How it works and the mechanisms involved}
	\item \textit{Advantages}
	\item \textit{Limitations}
\end{itemize} 

Deep learning models are a class of machine learning models that have the capability of automatically learning a hierarchical representation of data. These hierarchical representations are constructed through the use of artificial neural networks, the main underlying mechanism of deep learning models. Typically, large amounts of training data is required to train a model in learning the language model required to attain state of the art results, in the task of text classification for instance, the size of commonly used non-domain specific datasets range from hundreds of thousands of training examples to millions \cite{Conneau2017} \cite{Zhang} \textit{(note: look into the datasets used by state of the art approaches)}. Due to these constraints, it is not feasible to procure a dataset for the domain specific task of this project due to the aforementioned knowledge expertise and time requirements to manually label the articles required. Hence, \textit{(Talk about transfer learning/N-shot learning/domain adaptation here)} will be used to overcome this issue.

\textit{Introduce the typical architectures used for text classification e.g. RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, GRUs?}
