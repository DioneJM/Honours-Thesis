\documentclass[a4paper,twoside,phd]{BYUPhys}
% The BYUPhys class is for producing theses and dissertations
% in the BYU Department of Physics and Astronomy.  You can supply
% the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces double sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Introduction}

With the popularity and ubiquity of social platforms in today's society, the amount and the rate at which information is able to propagate online greatly outnumbers the manpower available that can evaluate the accuracy and determine the amount of misinformation within online articles. With factors such as the 'click-bait' nature and the lack of rigour surrounding the publishing of online content \cite{Sommariva2018} has caused an increase in the number of 'fake news' related content \cite{Vosoughi} \cite{germanFN}. This can be attributed to the trending or discover-based model commonly implemented by social media platforms that aim to maximize the reach and interaction of the content with no regards to its quality. In specific domains, such as for health related articles, the spread of misinformation can lead to the mistreatment and mismanagement of a range of health conditions.  \newline

One of the key components required to minimize the propagation of misinformation online is the ability to automatically evaluate and quantify the credibility of the information within articles. However, traditional automated methods - such as shallow learning-based techniques, still require the domain knowledge of experts to be able to develop the features required by the model. Thus, this project aims to investigate the performance of Deep Learning-based (DL) techniques in evaluating the credibility of information within domain-specific articles via the classification of set criteria that have deemed to be highly correlated with articles that have low credibility. Specifically, this project will focus on evaluating the credibility of online health articles related to vaccination due to the commonly misinformed and controversial views associated with its effects \cite{Burgess2006}. \newline


\section{Project Overview}
This section details the scope of the project and its associated outcomes outlining the various tasks that must be accomplished to successfully complete the project.

\subsection{Project Scope}
\label{sec:ProjectScope}

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning models in determining the credibility of online health-related articles. Due to the complexity of this project, a set of activities - divided into main goals and stretch goals, have been defined to ensure that the completion of this project remains feasible in the given time frame. The completion of all activities categorized as main goals will signal the realization of the primary objective and the completion of the project. The stretch goals are activities of interest that have been identified as non-essential to the completion of the primary objective but (talk about the overarching goal that all stretch goals have in common e.g. understand the model, utilize the model etc.) and will be worked on after the completion of the project.

\subsubsection{Main Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluate the performance of common ML-based methods for the classification of the 7 criteria in a specific domain
	\item Evaluate the performance of the chosen DL method for the same thing above
	\item Evaluate the effect of transfer learning methods in the performance of the DL method (assuming that the chosen method doesn't rely on transfer learning)
	\item Or maybe evaluate the performance of different transfer learning methods? e.g. zero vs few shot 
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilize attention mechanisms to understand how the previously evaluated models work?
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:DeepLearningReview}
\textit{Introduce the state-of-the-art DL based approaches for text classification and try to compare it performance with state-of-the-art ML approaches} \newline

Deep learning models are a class of machine learning models that have the capability of automatically learning a hierarchical representation of data. These hierarchical representations are constructed through the use of artificial neural networks, the main underlying mechanism of deep learning models. Typically, large amounts of training data is required to train a model in learning the language model required to attain state of the art results, in the task of text classification for instance, the size of commonly used non-domain specific datasets range from hundreds of thousands of training examples to millions \cite{Conneau2017} \cite{Zhang} \textit{(note: look into the datasets used by state of the art approaches)}. Due to these constraints, it is not feasible to procure a dataset for the domain specific task of this project due to the aforementioned knowledge expertise and time requirements to manually label the articles required. Hence, \textit{(Talk about transfer learning/N-shot learning/domain adaptation here)} will be used to overcome this issue.
