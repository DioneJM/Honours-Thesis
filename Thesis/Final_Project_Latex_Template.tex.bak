\documentclass[a4paper,twoside,phd]{BYUPhys}
% The BYUPhys class is for producing theses and dissertations
% in the BYU Department of Physics and Astronomy.  You can supply
% the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces double sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%
% --------------------------- Load Packages ---------------------------------

% The graphicx package allows the inclusion of figures.  Plain LaTeX and
% pdfLaTeX handle graphics differently. The following code checks which one
% you are compiling with, and switches the graphicx package options accordingly.
\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\else
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to easily customize the page header.
% The settings below produce a nice, well separated header.

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.
\usepackage{cite}

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.
%\usepackage{makeidx}
%\makeindex

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.
% physics.byu.edu.  This is helpful if you reference web pages.
\usepackage{url}
\urlstyle{rm}

% If you have a lot of equations, you might be interested in the amstex package.
% It defines a number of environments and macros that are helpful for mathematics.
% We don't do much math in this example, so we haven't used amstex here.

% The caption package allows us to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag

%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your

\section{Introduction \label{sec:Intro-ChapUserSelec}}

\begin{itemize}

\item We identify the limitations of current algorithms and situations where these algorithms are suboptimal.

\item We propose modifications of user selection algorithms that reduce execution complexity but retain efficiency.

\item We develop analytical bounds to show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically effective.

\item We compare the performance of the proposed user selection algorithms with the current user selection algorithms under both DPC and ZF precoding techniques.

\item We show that the proposed user selection algorithms reduce the computational complexity while retaining a high degree of effectiveness in terms of sum-capacity, as compared to other user selection algorithms, under both precoding techniques.

\end{itemize}


This chapter is organised as follows. Section \ref{sect:RelWorksingle-user} presents work related to this chapter. In Section \ref{sect:chap2sysmodel}, the system model is described. Section \ref{sect:precoding} describes precoding techniques. Section \ref{sect:sus} is devoted to the proposed user selection algorithms and presents the analytical bounds on the sum-capacity of the proposed user selection algorithms. Performance analysis of different user selection algorithms along with the proposed user selection algorithms is presented in Section \ref{sect:simresults}. Finally, Section \ref{sect:conc3} concludes the chapter.

\section{Related Work \label{sect:RelWorksingle-user}}

This chapter examined current user selection \cite{andrews05} algorithms for wireless broadcast channels. It compared the performance of the algorithms, identified situations where they were suboptimal and developed modifications to reduce computation time without reducing effectiveness. In particular, we presented a modified user selection algorithm, and then two variants were developed that could be used for both ZF and DPC precoding. It was shown that the proposed algorithms work reasonably well compared to other user selection algorithms. The modifications were tested and suggestions for setting parameters were made.
